**Note about Euler angles**
Before making any suggestion that involves Euler angles please read [this page](https://github.com/moble/quaternion/wiki/Euler-angles-are-horrible), especially the [last section](https://github.com/moble/quaternion/wiki/Euler-angles-are-horrible#opening-issues-and-pull-requests) which details how to open a feature request involving Euler angles.  In short, Euler angles are terrible, and I will be very skeptical of adding any features to this package that encourage their use.
