# Quaternion modules

This Python module adds a quaternion dtype to NumPy.

The code was originally based on
[code by Martin Ling](https://github.com/martinling/numpy_quaternion) (which he
wrote with help from Mark Weibe), but has been rewritten with ideas from
[rational](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-dtypes/tree/master/npytypes/rational)
to work with both python 2.x and 3.x, and to expand the applications of
quaternions (and to fix a few bugs).


## Dependencies

The basic requirements for this code are reasonably current versions of
`python` and `numpy`.  In particular, `python` versions 2.7, 3.4, and 3.5 are
[routinely tested](https://travis-ci.org/moble/quaternion).  Also, any `numpy`
version greater than 1.7.0 should work, but the tests are run on the most
recent release at the time of the test.

However, certain advanced functions in this package (including
`squad`, `mean_rotor_in_intrinsic_metric`,
`integrate_angular_velocity`, and related functions) require
[`scipy`](http://scipy.org/) and can automatically use
[`numba`](http://numba.pydata.org/).  `Scipy` is a standard python
package for scientific computation, and implements interfaces to C and
Fortran codes for optimization (among other things) need for finding
mean and optimal rotors.  `Numba` uses [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) to
compile python code to machine code, accelerating many numerical
functions by factors of anywhere from 2 to 2000.  It is *possible* to
run all the code without `numba`, but these particular functions are
roughly 4 to 400 times slower without it.

The only drawback of `numba` is that it is nontrivial to install on
its own.  Fortunately, the best python installer,
[`anaconda`](http://continuum.io/downloads), makes it trivial.  Just
install the main `anaconda` package, which installs both `numba` and
`scipy`.  If you prefer the smaller download size of
[`miniconda`](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) (which comes
with no extras beyond python), you'll also have to run this command:

```sh
conda install pip numpy scipy numba
```

## Installation

Assuming you use `conda` to manage your python installation (like any sane
python user), you can install this package simply as

```sh
conda install -c moble quaternion
```

If you prefer to use `pip` (whether or not you use `conda`), you can also do

```sh
pip install git+git://github.com/moble/quaternion
```

If you refuse to use `conda`, you might want to install inside your home
directory without root privileges.  (Anaconda does this by default anyway.)
This is done by adding `--user` to the above command:

```sh
pip install --user git+git://github.com/moble/quaternion
```

Finally, there's also the fully manual option of just downloading the code,
changing to the code directory, and issuing

```sh
python setup.py install
```

This should work regardless of the installation method, as long as you have a
compiler hanging around.


## Usage

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import quaternion
>>> np.quaternion(1,0,0,0)
quaternion(1, 0, 0, 0)
>>> q1 = np.quaternion(1,2,3,4)
>>> q2 = np.quaternion(5,6,7,8)
>>> q1 * q2
quaternion(-60, 12, 30, 24)
>>> a = np.array([q1, q2])
>>> a
array([quaternion(1, 2, 3, 4), quaternion(5, 6, 7, 8)], dtype=quaternion)
>>> exp(a)
array([quaternion(1.69392, -0.78956, -1.18434, -1.57912),
       quaternion(138.909, -25.6861, -29.9671, -34.2481)], dtype=quaternion)
```

The following ufuncs are implemented (which means they run fast on
numpy arrays):

```python
add, subtract, multiply, divide, log, exp, power, negative, conjugate,
copysign, equal, not_equal, less, less_equal, isnan, isinf, isfinite, absolute
```

Quaternion components are stored as doubles.  Numpy arrays with
`dtype=quaternion` can be accessed as arrays of doubles without any
(slow, memory-consuming) copying of data; rather, a `view` of the
exact same memory space can be created within a microsecond,
regardless of the shape or size of the quaternion array.

Comparison operations follow the same lexicographic ordering as
tuples.

The unary tests isnan and isinf return true if they would return true
for any individual component; isfinite returns true if it would return
true for all components.

Real types may be cast to quaternions, giving quaternions with zero
for all three imaginary components. Complex types may also be cast to
quaternions, with their single imaginary component becoming the first
imaginary component of the quaternion. Quaternions may not be cast to
real or complex types.


## Bug reports and feature requests

Bug reports and feature requests are entirely welcome.  The best way to do this
is to open an
[issue on this code's github page](https://github.com/moble/quaternion/issues).
For bug reports, please try to include a minimal working example demonstrating
the problem.

[Pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) are also
entirely welcome, of course, if you have an idea where the code is going wrong,
or have an idea for a new feature that you know how to implement.

This code is [routinely tested](https://travis-ci.org/moble/quaternion) on
recent versions of both python (2.x and 3.x) and numpy (>=1.7).  But the test
coverage is not necessarily as complete as it could be, so bugs may certainly
be present, especially in the higher-level functions like `mean_rotor_...`.


## Acknowledgments

This code is, of course, hosted on github.  Because it is an open-source
project, the hosting is free, and all the wonderful features of github are
available, including free wiki space and web page hosting, pull requests, a
nice interface to the git logs, etc.  Github user Hannes Ovr√©n (hovren) pointed
out some errors in a previous version of this code and suggested some nice
utility functions for rotation matrices, etc.

Every change in this code is
[auomatically tested](https://travis-ci.org/moble/quaternion) on
[Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/).  This is a free service (for open-source
projects like this one), which integrates beautifully with github, detecting
each commit and automatically re-running the tests.  The code is downloaded and
installed fresh each time, and then tested, on each of the five different
versions of python.  This ensures that no change I make to the code breaks
either installation or any of the features that I have written tests for.

Finally, the code is automatically compiled, and the binaries hosted for
download by `conda` on [anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/moble/quaternion).
This is also a free service for open-source projects like this one.

The work of creating this code was supported in part by the Sherman
Fairchild Foundation and by NSF Grants No. PHY-1306125 and
AST-1333129.
